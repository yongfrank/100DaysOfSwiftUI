## Overview

Before dive into the file, I want to show you two things: Technology and Beyond WWDC2022

## Techonology

In this App, we help people to be familiar with flags. All the flags you love are stored in your device safely. You can take notes, play a quiz, draw the picture to deepen the understanding of flags as well as the new culture in the every corner of the world. 

With the help of SwiftUI technology, there are better interface and advanced user experience in the app, such as delicate design, flags in the stack, animation of flag and so on. Thanks to the Code-based CoreData, all your beloved flags and notes will always stay with you. You can review it anytime: before seeing an amazing foreign film, getting to know a country after the history class, or the anniversary of your moving in a new place. And then, SF Symbols and Emoji also help a lot. The whole assets of app are based on these two unprecedented symbol system. There are abundant resources that can be used by developers and users. Apple Pencil is a good partner of iPad. It’s also a good partner when you are creating something. PencilKit and Apple Pencil create an amazing painting experience. 

According to the theory of general memory process, it will be better to memorize new things if you stimulate multipart of your sense. So, we try to use different ways to help people knowing the familiar and unfamiliar emoji flags in the emoji keyboard. We know the importance of discovering the world. And we also know the importance of connection between different culture. 

United we stand, divided we fall. Hope the app not only helps people removing the unknown, but also strengthen the unity between world. 

## Beyond WWDC22

If you’ve shared or considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others, let us know

The first time I immerse myself in Swift and SwiftUI is the winter break at the beginning of this year. I was attracted by the simplicity and neatness of this programming language compared with C, Java. 

I joined iOS Club last year, a club for all students who have interest in Apple. And in the club, I know a program called Apple Teacher. Apple Store is a place for people to study and share knowledge about Apple products. But there aren’t Apple Store everywhere. So Apple Teacher is a program held at every Apple authorized reseller to spread equity in Education. At Dec. 2021, Swift Playgrounds 4 was released and we focused on programming that winter. I learn more about Swift and SwiftUI that time with this opportunity. 

Kids are creative more than we can imagine with only these few days. The new programming language is easy to learn, and the kids created their own apps in just 3 days. They give me the sense of pride and let me know what’s the meaning of education and “open source spirit” in the world of computer science.  

And the inspiration of this App comes from Apple Teacher Program. Before introducing programming language, we talk about different countries and different flags. I found them have hug
